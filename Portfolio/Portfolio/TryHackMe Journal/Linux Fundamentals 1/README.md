Date Completed: 09/10/24

## Overview
This project is a walkthrough of the TryHackMe "Linux Fundamentals" challenge. The goal was to gain a better understanding of Linux commands, file system navigation, and basic scripting. I completed a series of exercises designed to simulate real-world scenarios for working with Linux systems.

## Technologies Used
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Terminal
- Bash scripting

## How to Reproduce
1. Log in to TryHackMe and access the "Linux Fundamentals" challenge.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the challenge.
3. Use the following commands:
   - `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, etc. for file navigation.
   - Basic Bash scripting: `chmod +x script.sh`
4. Review the output files in this repository for examples.

## Key Findings
- Learned how to navigate the Linux file system effectively.
- Wrote simple Bash scripts to automate tasks.
- Discovered common security practices in Linux environments.

## Included Files
- `report.md`: Detailed write-up of the challenge and findings.
- `screenshots/`: Visual evidence of challenge completion.
- `results.txt`: Raw output from terminal sessions.
